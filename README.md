## My Experience:

As a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about learning offensive security. I was very ambitious to take on eLearning Security's Penetration Testing Student learning path. After earning the CompTIA PenTest+ certification as part of my pentesting journey in November of 2023, the lab based training with eJPT really helped follow up with putting these concepts into practice. Allowing me to apply these techniques and expand in my virtual and physical lab setups.
